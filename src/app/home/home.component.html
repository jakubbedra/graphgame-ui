    Here you will find various tasks related to graph algorithms, that will help you learn for your upcoming exams.
  </p>

  <h2>Controls</h2>

  <h3>Overall:</h3>
  <p>
    While holding the right mouse button on a vertex, you can move it freely across the board.
  </p>

  <h3>Drawing a graph: </h3>
  <p>
    Left click on empty space to add a vertex. Left click on a vertex to remove it. Left click and hold
    on a vertex in order to start drawing an edge. In order to finish drawing an edge, drag the mouse cursor
    to another vertex, and then release the left button.
  </p>

  <h3>Selecting vertices in order: </h3>
  <p>
    Left click on a vertex to select it. Left click on the last selected vertex to unselect it.
    The numbers inside the vertices represent the order in which computer generates those vertices
  </p>

  <h3>Selecting edges in order: </h3>
  <p>
    Left click on an edge to select it. Left click on the last selected vertex to unselect it. If you want to select more than one edge
    at once, right click the edge instead.
